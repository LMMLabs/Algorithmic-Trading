# Algorithmic Trading
This repository contains all of the Portfolio Trading Algorithms tested and/or developed by LMM Labs.  The files in this repository have .py extensions, but they are really Quantopian algorithms.  This is because Quantopian algorithms use a Pythin like syntax.  The semantics of the language is a little different, however, so these files will not run as Python programs unless additional Python libraries are loaded and code modifications are made.
